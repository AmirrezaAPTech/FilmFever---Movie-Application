FilmFever is a Movie Search app that allows users to search for popular movies and view their details, such as title, rating, overview, and release date. The app also provides a popup feature to display additional information about each movie.

## Prerequisites

- HTML file to embed the JavaScript code
- CSS file for styling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the JavaScript file.
2. Create an HTML file and link the JavaScript file using the `<script>` tag.
3. Create a CSS file and link it to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The app will automatically load popular movies on the initial page.
